PLAN - Dockerfiles
-------------------
~~~1. Clean and fix base image (in "test" folder) to get novnc working, also to reduce size - see https://hackernoon.com/tips-to-reduce-docker-image-sizes-876095da3b34~~~

~~~1.b Sort NoVNC and desktop env. Maybe VSCode settings too~~~

2. Get "apps" working (ros2-new/Fluff) ~~~First moveit,~~~ then ros2-web-bridge

3. Deprecate other tags, work solely from incremental, dockerfile based builds to reduce damage post crash

~~~4. Check that we can use openrave with ros2~~~ We can! Reqs in Changelog

5. Build openrave docker for creating ~~~ikfast~~~, reachability (low priority for reach atm)

6. Test for any missing dependencies with the denso lib


NB: For treating
Errors were encountered while processing:
#6 590.1  python2.7-minimal
#6 590.1  python2-minimal
#6 590.1  python2.7

Last fix involved upgrade-alternatives. test version in base. Check "ros2_ws/Clean"


^^^ THINK THIS IS FIXED BY REMOVING PYTHON-NUMPY FROM THE BASE
